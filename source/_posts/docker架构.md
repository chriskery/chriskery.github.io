## Docker Architecutre
Docker uses a client-server architecture. The Docker client talks to the Docker daemon, which does the heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing your Docker containers. The Docker client and daemon can run on the same system, or you can connect a Docker client to a remote Docker daemon. The Docker client and daemon communicate using a REST API, over UNIX sockets or a network interface.

### [The Docker daemon](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/#the-docker-daemon)

The Docker daemon (`dockerd`) listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes. A daemon can also communicate with other daemons to manage Docker services.

### [The Docker client](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/#the-docker-client)

The Docker client (`docker`) is the primary way that many Docker users interact with Docker. When you use commands such as `docker run`, the client sends these commands to `dockerd`, which carries them out. The `docker` command uses the Docker API. The Docker client can communicate with more than one daemon.

### [Docker registries](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/#docker-registries)

A Docker registry stores Docker images. Docker Hub is a public registry that anyone can use, and Docker looks for images on Docker Hub by default. You can even run your own private registry.

When you use the `docker pull` or `docker run` commands, Docker pulls the required images from your configured registry. When you use the `docker push` command, Docker pushes your image to your configured registry.

### [Docker objects](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/#docker-objects)

When you use Docker, you are creating and using images, containers, networks, volumes, plugins, and other objects. This section is a brief overview of some of those objects.

#### [Images](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/#images)

An image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. Often, an image is based on another image, with some additional customization. For example, you may build an image which is based on the `ubuntu` image, but installs the Apache web server and your application, as well as the configuration details needed to make your application run.

You might create your own images or you might only use those created by others and published in a registry. To build your own image, you create a Dockerfile with a simple syntax for defining the steps needed to create the image and run it. Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a layer in the image. When you change the Dockerfile and rebuild the image, only those layers which have changed are rebuilt. This is part of what makes images so lightweight, small, and fast, when compared to other virtualization technologies.

#### [Containers](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/#containers)

A container is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI. You can connect a container to one or more networks, attach storage to it, or even create a new image based on its current state.

By default, a container is relatively well isolated from other containers and its host machine. You can control how isolated a container's network, storage, or other underlying subsystems are from other containers or from the host machine.

A container is defined by its image as well as any configuration options you provide to it when you create or start it. When a container is removed, any changes to its state that aren't stored in persistent storage disappear.

##### [Example docker run command](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/#example-docker-run-command)

The following command runs an `ubuntu` container, attaches interactively to your local command-line session, and runs `/bin/bash`.

```
$ docker run -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash
```

When you run this command, the following happens (assuming you are using the default registry configuration):

1.  If you don't have the `ubuntu` image locally, Docker pulls it from your configured registry, as though you had run `docker pull ubuntu` manually.
    
2.  Docker creates a new container, as though you had run a `docker container create` command manually.
    
3.  Docker allocates a read-write filesystem to the container, as its final layer. This allows a running container to create or modify files and directories in its local filesystem.
    
4.  Docker creates a network interface to connect the container to the default network, since you didn't specify any networking options. This includes assigning an IP address to the container. By default, containers can connect to external networks using the host machine's network connection.
    
5.  Docker starts the container and executes `/bin/bash`. Because the container is running interactively and attached to your terminal (due to the `-i` and `-t` flags), you can provide input using your keyboard while Docker logs the output to your terminal.
    
6.  When you run `exit` to terminate the `/bin/bash` command, the container stops but isn't removed. You can start it again or remove it.

## Docker完整架构
从 Docker 1.11 版本开始，Docker 容器运行就不是简单通过 Docker Daemon 来启动了，而是通过集成 containerd、runc 等多个组件来完成的。虽然 Docker Daemon 守护进程模块在不停的重构，但是基本功能和定位没有太大的变化，一直都是 CS 架构，守护进程负责和 Docker Client 端交互，并管理 Docker 镜像和容器。现在的架构中组件 containerd 就会负责集群节点上容器的生命周期管理，并向上为 Docker Daemon 提供 gRPC 接口。

![docker 架构](https://picdn.youdianzhishi.com/images/20210809154608.png)

当我们要创建一个容器的时候，现在 Docker Daemon 并不能直接帮我们创建了，而是请求 `containerd` 来创建一个容器，containerd 收到请求后，也并不会直接去操作容器，而是创建一个叫做 `containerd-shim` 的进程，让这个进程去操作容器，我们指定容器进程是需要一个父进程来做状态收集、维持 stdin 等 fd 打开等工作的，假如这个父进程就是 containerd，那如果 containerd 挂掉的话，整个宿主机上所有的容器都得退出了，而引入 `containerd-shim` 这个垫片就可以来规避这个问题了。

然后创建容器需要做一些 namespaces 和 cgroups 的配置，以及挂载 root 文件系统等操作，这些操作其实已经有了标准的规范，那就是 OCI（开放容器标准），`runc` 就是它的一个参考实现.这个标准其实就是一个文档，主要规定了容器镜像的结构、以及容器需要接收哪些操作指令，比如 create、start、stop、delete 等这些命令。`runc` 就可以按照这个 OCI 文档来创建一个符合规范的容器，既然是标准肯定就有其他 OCI 实现，比如 Kata、gVisor 这些容器运行时都是符合 OCI 标准的。

所以真正启动容器是通过 `containerd-shim` 去调用 `runc` 来启动容器的，`runc` 启动完容器后本身会直接退出，`containerd-shim` 则会成为容器进程的父进程, 负责收集容器进程的状态, 上报给 containerd, 并在容器中 pid 为 1 的进程退出后接管容器中的子进程进行清理, 确保不会出现僵尸进程。
